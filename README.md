🚀 **Building an AI Resume Analyzer using Streamlit + LLMs** 🤖📄

I’m currently working on an **AI-powered Resume Analyzer** that helps evaluate resumes more intelligently using **Large Language Models** and a clean **Streamlit interface**.

### ❓ **Why build an AI Resume Analyzer?**

📌 Recruiters scan resumes in seconds
📌 Many strong profiles get missed due to formatting or keyword gaps
📌 Candidates often don’t know *why* their resume isn’t shortlisted
📌 Resume screening should be **fair, explainable, and skill-focused**

This project aims to bridge that gap using AI.
